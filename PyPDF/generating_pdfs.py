# Generating PDFs with ReportLab module

# We can create a title, some text in paragraphs, and some charts and images. For that, we're going to use what
# reportlab calls Flowables. Flowables are sort of like chunks of a document that reportlab can arrange
# to make a complete report. Let's import some Flowable classes.

from reportlab.platypus import SimpleDocTemplate

fruit = {
  "elderberries": 1,
  "figs": 1,
  "apples": 2,
  "durians": 3,
  "bananas": 5,
  "cherries": 8,
  "grapes": 13
}

report = SimpleDocTemplate("report.pdf")

# Each of these items (Paragraph, Spacer, Table, and Image) are classes that build individual elements in the final
# document. We have to tell reportlab what style we want each part of the document to have, so let's import some more
# things from the module to describe style. Styles are similar to html tags like h1 and so on.
styles = getSampleStyleSheet()

report_title = Paragraph("A Complete Inventory of My Fruit", styles["h1"])

# convert fruit dictionary to list of lists aka 2D array so we can insert as chart in PDF
table_data = []
for k,v in fruit.items():
  table_data.append([k,v])

table_style = [('GRID', (0,0), (-1,-1), 1, colors.black)]
report_table = Table(data=table_data, style=table_style, hAlign="LEFT")

report_pie = Pie(width=6, height=6)

# to add data into a pie chart for ReportLab, we must have 2 different list data sets.
# One for the actual values in the pie chart, and one for the labels of each of those values
report_pie.labels = sorted(list(fruit.keys()))
# labels attribute of a pie chart
report_pie.data = sorted(list(fruit.values()))
# data attribute of a pie chart


# The Pie object isnâ€™t Flowable, but it can be placed inside of a Flowable Drawing.
report_chart = Drawing()
report_chart.add(report_pie)

# Let's take a look at what this will look like. We can build the PDF now by using the build() method of our report.
# It takes a list of Flowable elements, and generates a PDF with them.
report.build([report_title, report_table, report_chart])
