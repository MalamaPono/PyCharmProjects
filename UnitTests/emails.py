# FINAL QWIKLABS ASSIGNMENT FOR TESTING AND EXCEPTIONS

# Imagine one of your IT coworkers just retired and left a folder of scripts for you to use. One of the scripts, called
# emails.py, matches users to an email address and lets us easily look them up! For the most part, the script works
# great â€” you enter in an employee's name and their email is printed to the screen. But, for some employees, the
# output doesn't look quite right. Your job is to add a test to reproduce the bug, make the necessary corrections, and
# verify that all the tests pass to make sure the script works! Best of luck!
#
# What you'll do
# In this lab, you will:
#
# Write a simple test to check for basic functionality
# Write a test to check for edge cases
# Correct code with a try/except statement'
